    * Annual Dividend per Share / Current Market Price per Share x 100%. Dividend Yield = $4 / $150 x 100% = 2.67%. How much you
      will year on investing every 100$
2. P/E ratio
    * P/E Ratio = Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share (EPS). Basically the number of years it will take for a stock to
      repay the amount you spend on it. The smaller, the 'cheaper' stocks is. A higher P/E ratio generally indicates that
      investors are willing to pay a higher price for each unit of earnings, suggesting expectations of future growth or positive
      market sentiment. A lower P/E ratio, on the other hand, may indicate that the stock is relatively cheaper compared to its
      earnings.

### Some general investing terms:

1. Type of Stocks
    * Growth stocks are shares of companies that are expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to the overall market or
      their industry peers. These companies typically reinvest their earnings back into the business. Example: Amazon , Google,
      Tesla

      dividends. These companies are often more mature, established, and generate consistent profits. Example: Johnson & Johnson,
      Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble

    * Mutual Funds: Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities such as
      stocks, bonds, and other assets. They are managed by professional fund managers who make investment decisions based on the
      fund's stated objectives.
    * Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): ETFs are similar to mutual funds but trade on stock exchanges like individual stocks. They
      represent a basket of securities designed to track a specific index, sector, commodity, or asset class. ETFs provide
      investors with exposure to a wide range of assets in a single investment.
    * Index Funds: Index funds are a type of mutual fund or ETF that aim to replicate the performance of a specific market index,
      such as the S&P 500. They passively invest in the securities comprising the index, aiming to match its returns rather than
      actively selecting investments.

      deposit, and commercial paper. They aim to provide stability and preserve capital while generating modest returns. Money
      market funds are often used as a cash management tool.
    * Bond Funds: Bond funds invest in a portfolio of fixed-income securities, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, and
      municipal bonds. They provide income through interest payments and seek to achieve capital preservation and steady returns.
    * Equity Funds: Equity funds invest primarily in stocks or equity securities. They can focus on specific market segments,
      sectors, or geographic regions. Equity funds offer potential for capital appreciation but also carry higher risks compared
      to fixed-income funds.
    * Sector Funds: Sector funds concentrate their investments in specific sectors of the economy, such as technology, healthcare,
      energy, or financial services. They allow investors to target specific industries or themes.
    * Balanced Funds: Balanced funds, also known as asset allocation funds, invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and sometimes other
      asset classes. They aim to provide a balanced approach to growth and income while managing risk.

      properties. Investors can buy shares of REITs, which provide exposure to real estate without directly owning properties.
    * Hedge Funds: Hedge funds are alternative investment vehicles that typically cater to institutional or high-net-worth
      investors. They employ various investment strategies, including long/short positions, derivatives, leverage, and alternative
      assets, aiming for absolute returns.

    * Passive investing, also known as passive management or index investing, is an investment strategy that aims to replicate the
      performance of a specific market index rather than trying to outperform it. It involves investing in a diversified portfolio
      of securities that closely mirror the composition and weightings of a particular index, such as the S&P 500 or the FTSE 100
