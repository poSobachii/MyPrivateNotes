**What is a Docker ?** 

Docker is an open-source tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers engine that uses the Linux Kernel features. 
Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and deploy it as one package.
Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.

**Docker image**
A Docker image contains application code, libraries, tools, dependencies and other files needed to make an application run. 
When a user runs an image, it can become one or many instances of a container. Docker images have multiple layers, each one originates from the previous layer but is different from it.


**Docker container**
Docker images are read-only templates used to build containers. Containers are deployed instances created from those templates
A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.


**Docker volumes**
Docker volumes are file systems mounted on Docker containers to preserve data generated by the running container. 
The volumes are stored on the host, independent of the container life cycle. This allows users to back up data and share file systems between containers easily.
