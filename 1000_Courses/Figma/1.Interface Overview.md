# 1.Interface Overview

## Understanding the Figma User Interface:

The Figma user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience for both beginners and
experienced designers. Let's explore the key components of the Figma interface:

+ <b>Toolbar:</b> The top section of the Figma interface contains the toolbar, which houses various tools and options to create,
  edit, and manipulate design elements. Here, you'll find tools for drawing shapes, adding text, selecting objects, and more.
+ <b>Canvas:</b> The central area of the interface is the canvas, where you create and design your projects. This is where you'll
  place and arrange all the elements of your design, such as shapes, images, and text.
+ <b>Layers Panel (Design Tree):</b> On the left side of the interface, you'll find the Layers panel, also known as the Design
  Tree. This panel displays the hierarchical structure of all the design elements present on the canvas. You can use it to
  navigate, select, and manage different layers, groups, and components in your design.
+ <b>Properties Panel:</b> The right side of the interface houses the Properties panel. It shows the properties and attributes of
  the selected design element. Depending on what you've selected, you can adjust properties such as size, position, colors,
  typography, and more.
+ <b>Design Tools:</b> Located in the toolbar, these tools allow you to create and edit different design elements. Some of the
  primary design tools include the Pen tool for drawing custom shapes, the Text tool for adding text layers, and the Rectangle and
  Ellipse tools for creating shapes.
+ <b>Prototype Panel:</b> Figma also has a Prototype panel, which allows you to create and manage interactive prototypes. You can
  define links between frames to simulate user interactions and create smooth transitions.

## Navigating the Figma Interface:

+ <b>Panning and Zooming:</b> To navigate around the canvas, you can use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out, or you can hold down
  the Spacebar and drag with the mouse to pan across the canvas.
+ <b>Selecting Elements:</b> To select an element, click on it in the canvas or use the Layers panel to choose the desired layer.
  Multiple elements can be selected by holding the Shift key while clicking on them.
+ <b>Moving and Resizing Elements:</b> Once an element is selected, you can move it by clicking and dragging. To resize an element, drag
  any of the resizing handles that appear when the element is selected.

## Layers and Hierarchy:

Figma uses a layer-based approach to organize design elements. Each element is represented as a layer in the Layers panel, forming
a hierarchical structure. Layers are organized from top to bottom based on their stacking order on the canvas. You can group
layers to keep related elements together and use frames to define specific areas of the design.
