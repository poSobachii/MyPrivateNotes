Arrays vs Collections :
Arrays
1. Size is fixed
2. Can hold both primitive types(boolean, byte, short, int, long â€¦etc) and object types.
3. There is no underlying data structures in arrays. The array itself used as data structure in java.
4. There is no utility methods in arrays

Collections
1. Size is not fixed, size is growable
2. Can hold only object types
3. Every Collection class there is underlying data structure.
4. Every Collection provides utility methods
