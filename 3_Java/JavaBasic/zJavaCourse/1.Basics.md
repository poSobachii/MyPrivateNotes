## 1.1 Variables

### <u>Declaration</u>

In Java, a variable is a container of reserved area allocated in memory, used to store data that can be accessed, manipulated, and
utilized in your programs. To use a
variable, you must declare it, specifying its data type and a name that uniquely identifies it within its scope. Variable
declaration is one of the fundamental concepts in Java, and it plays a crucial role in defining the behavior and structure of your
programs.

<b>Key Components of Variable Declaration:</b>

+ <b>Data type:</b> Every variable in Java is associated with a data type, which defines the type of data it can hold. Java has
  two categories of data types: <b>primitive</b> and <b>reference</b>. Primitive data types include `int`, `float`, `char`, and
  others, while reference data types include objects, such as `String`, `Integer` and user-defined classes. The data type
  determines the range and operations that can be performed on the variable.
+ <b>Variable name:</b>A variable name is an identifier that uniquely represents the variable within its scope. Variable names are
  case-sensitive and must adhere to certain naming conventions. They should start with a letter, dollar sign (<b>$</b>), or
  underscore (<b> _ </b>) and can be followed by letters, digits, dollar signs, and underscores.
  For example:

```java 
class Application {
    int age;           // Declares an integer variable named 'age'
    double price;      // Declares a double-precision floating-point variable named 'price'
    String name;       // Declares a reference variable named 'name' to store a String object
}
```

While declaring a variable, you can also provide an initial value. This is known as variable initialization. For example:

```java 
class Application {
    int count = 0;             // Initializes 'count' to 0
    double temperature = 23.5; // Initializes 'temperature' to 23.5
    String message = "Hello";  // Initializes 'message' with the string "Hello"
}
```

### <u>Scopes</u>

Variable scopes in Java determine the accessibility or visibility of a variable within a program. It defines the boundaries within
which a variable can be accessed and used. There are three primary types of variable scopes in Java:\
<b>Local variables:</b>
Local variables are declared within a method or a code block. Their scope is limited to the method or block in which they are
declared. They cannot be accessed outside of that method or block.\
<b>Instance variables:</b>
Instance variables, also known as fields, are declared within a class but outside any method or block. They are associated with
objects of that class and can be accessed from any method or block within the class, including subclasses.\
<b>Class variables:</b>
Static variables, also known as class variables, are declared within a class using the 'static' keyword. They are associated with
the class itself, not with individual objects. They can be accessed from any method or block within the class, including
subclasses, using the class name.\
<b>Parameters:</b>
Method parameters are a type of local variable, and they have the same scope as other local variables. They exist only within the
method where they are declared. They act as placeholders to receive values when the method or constructor is called:

```java
class Application {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Calling a methods with String parameters
      greetUser("John");
      greetUser("Alice");
   }
   
    // A method that takes a String parameter `name`
    public static void greetUser(String name) {
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }
}
```
