## 1.1 Variables

### <u>Declaration</u>

In Java, a variable is a container of reserved area allocated in memory, used to store data that can be accessed, manipulated, and utilized in your
programs. To use a variable, you must declare it, specifying its data type and a name that uniquely identifies it within its scope. Variable
declaration is one of the fundamental concepts in Java, and it plays a crucial role in defining the behavior and structure of your programs.

<b>Key Components of Variable Declaration:</b>

+ <b>Data type:</b> Every variable in Java is associated with a data type, which defines the type of data it can hold. Java has two categories of data
  types: <b>primitive</b> and <b>reference</b>. Primitive data types include `int`, `float`, `char`, and others, while reference data types include
  objects, such as `String`, `Integer` and user-defined classes. The data type determines the range and operations that can be performed on the
  variable.
+ <b>Variable name:</b>A variable name is an identifier that uniquely represents the variable within its scope. Variable names are case-sensitive and
  must adhere to certain naming conventions. They should start with a letter, dollar sign (<b>$</b>), or underscore (<b> _ </b>) and can be followed
  by letters, digits, dollar signs, and underscores. For example:

```java 
class Application {
    int age;           // Declares an integer variable named 'age'
    double price;      // Declares a double-precision floating-point variable named 'price'
    String name;       // Declares a reference variable named 'name' to store a String object
}
```

While declaring a variable, you can also provide an initial value. This is known as variable initialization. For example:

```java 
class Application {
    int count = 0;             // Initializes 'count' to 0
    double temperature = 23.5; // Initializes 'temperature' to 23.5
    String message = "Hello";  // Initializes 'message' with the string "Hello"
}
```

### <u>Scopes</u>

Variable scopes in Java determine the accessibility or visibility of a variable within a program. It defines the boundaries within which a variable
can be accessed and used. There are three primary types of variable scopes in Java:\
<b>Local variables:</b>
Local variables are declared within a method or a code block. Their scope is limited to the method or block in which they are declared. They cannot be
accessed outside of that method or block:

```java
class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declared local String variable. It can be accessible only inside main() method.
        String name = "John";
        System.out.println("Hello " + name);
        greetUser();
    }

    // This is another method with another local variable. Despite it has the same naming, 
    // it differs from previous one, as scope of this local variable is only within greetUser() method
    public static void greetUser() {
        String name = "Adam";
        System.out.println("Hello user - " + name + "!");
    }
}
```

<b>Instance variables:</b>
Instance variables, also known as <b>fields</b>/<b>global</b> variables are declared within a class but outside any method or block. They are
associated with objects of that class and can be accessed from any method or block within the class, including subclasses.

```java
class Application {

    // Declared String field. It can be accessible anywhere in this class.
    private String name = "Michael";

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scratch main = new Scratch();
        main.greetUser();
        main.greetUserAgain();
    }

    // Prints out text message using global `name` variable.
    public void greetUser() {
        System.out.println("Hello user - " + name + "!");
    }

    // This method prints out text message using the same `name` variable, used in greetUser() method.
    public void greetUserAgain() {
        System.out.println("Hello again, " + name + "!!");
    }
}
```

<b>Class variables:</b>
Static variables, also known as class variables, are declared within a class using the 'static' keyword. They are associated with the class itself,
not with individual objects. They can be accessed from any method or block within the class, including subclasses, using the class name.

```java
class Application {

    public static String NAME = "John";

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // You can call this variable by accessing class.variablesName itself anywhere from your app
        System.out.println("Hello, " + Application.name + "!");
    }

    public void greetUser() {
        System.out.println("Hello user - " + Application.name + "!");
    }
}
```

<span style="color:red">At this point you might not see big difference between `instance` and `class` variables, as <b>class variable</b> is binded to
specific class not the object. Things will be more clear later, when we learn about object and how to interact with them.</span>\
<b>Parameters:</b>
Method parameters are a type of local variable, and they have the same scope as other local variables. They exist only within the method where they
are declared. They act as placeholders to receive values when the method or constructor is called:

```java
class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Calling a methods with String parameters
        greetUser("John");
        greetUser("Alice");
    }

    // A method that takes a String parameter and puts it in `name` variable
    public static void greetUser(String name) {
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }
}
```

### <u>Variable shadowing</u>

Variable shadowing in Java occurs when a variable declared in an inner scope has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. When this
happens, the variable in the inner scope hides or shadows the variable in the outer scope. This means that when you refer to the variable name within
the inner scope, you are actually referring to the variable declared in the inner scope, not the variable declared in the outer scope:

```java
class Application {
    static int number = 10;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 20;
        System.out.println(number); // Prints 20
    }
}
```

Variable shadowing can be a useful tool for improving code readability and maintainability. It can help to make code more self-documenting and easier
to understand. However, it is important to use variable shadowing carefully, as it can also make code more difficult to debug if you are not careful.

Here are some guidelines for using variable shadowing:

* Only use variable shadowing when it is clear that you are referring to the variable in the inner scope.
* Use descriptive variable names to avoid confusion.
* Comment your code to explain why you are using variable shadowing.

In general, it is a good practice to avoid using variable shadowing unless you have a good reason to do so. If you can avoid it, it is usually better
to use a different variable name in the inner scope to avoid confusion.

### <u>Data types. Primitives vs non-primitives</u>

In Java, data types can be categorized into two main groups: primitive data types and non-primitive data types (also known as reference types):

1. Primitive Data Types - represent simple values and are built into the language. Java supports eight primitive data types:
    * <b>byte</b>: A 8-bit signed integer, ranging from -128 to 127 `byte myByte = 10;`
    * <b>short</b>: A 16-bit signed integer, ranging from -32768 to 32767 `short myShort = 20000;`
    * <b>int</b>: A 32-bit signed integer, ranging from -2147483648 to 2147483647 `int myInt = 123456789;`
    * <b>long</b>: A 64-bit signed integer, ranging from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807 `long myLong = 9876543210L;`
    * <b>float</b>: A 32-bit single-precision floating-point number `float myFloat = 3.14159265f;`
    * <b>double</b>: A 64-bit double-precision floating-point number `double myDouble = 123.4567890123456789;`
    * <b>char</b>: A 16-bit Unicode character `char myChar = 'A';`
    * <b>boolean</b>: A true or false value `boolean myBoolean = true;`
2. Non-Primitive Data Types (Reference Types) - Non-primitive data types are more complex data structures and include: <u>Strings</u>, <u>
   Arrays</u>, <u>Classes</u>, <u>Interfaces</u>, <u>Enumerations (Enums)</u>. For example:

```java
class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Array of integers
        int[] intArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

        // String
        String greeting = "Hello, Java!";

        // Class instance
        MyClass myObject = new MyClass();
    }
}

class MyClass {
    // Class definition
}
```

The use of the word `new` is common when initializing non-primitive types in Java, but it's not a strict rule for all cases. The `new` keyword is
specifically used to create an instance of a class or an array in Java, and most non-primitive types fall into these categories:

<span style="color:red; font-weight: bold">Important !</span> Understanding the distinction primitive/non-primitive is crucial for memory management
and understanding how variables behave in Java, but this is some advanced level topics, for now lets stick to the point where primitive data types
store simple values directly, while non-primitive types store references to memory locations where the data is held. Real-world example would be:

1. <b>Cupboard Box with a Cookie (Primitive):</b> A cupboard box containing a cookie directly represents a primitive type. The box holds a simple,
   standalone value (the cookie). In Java terms, this is akin to having a primitive variable, like int or char, directly holding a simple value.
2. <b>Bakery Store with a Catalogue (Non-Primitive):</b> The bakery store with a catalogue is an excellent representation of non-primitive types. The
   catalogue provides references or locations (similar to memory addresses or references) to various cookie boxes in the store. In Java, this is
   analogous to using non-primitive types like arrays, collections, or objects that hold references to more complex structures.
